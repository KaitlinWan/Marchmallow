# What Does the Data Say?

### Hypothesis
If there is a size n array of integers, then we believe that quicksort will exhibit a worst case (), average case O(nlogn) runtime, and a best case of ().


### Background
Find the runtime of quicksort for a n size array of integers. 
Find how the pivot selection and data arrangement affects execution time.

### Experiment Methodology


### Results


### Conclusions







To do:

- worst case

- best case

- random
